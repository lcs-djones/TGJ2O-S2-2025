# üß† Daily Notion Entries

Each class, you are expected to complete a short **Notion portfolio entry** that tracks your progress, learning, and reflection. These posts act as your **digital portfolio**, showing not just what you created, but how you got there.

Your entries will help document your growth across all stages of the design process ‚Äî from early experimentation to final products. They also provide me with detailed evidence of your learning and progress when I evaluate your KTCA marks.

## üí¨ Why We‚Äôre Doing This

Your Notion portfolio is where you **show your process**, not just the end result.  
When you upload screenshots, describe techniques, explain choices, and reflect on challenges, you are:

- Building evidence for your **Knowledge, Thinking, Communication, and Application** marks
    
- Practicing **self-reflection**, which is a key part of real creative work
    
- Helping me see your effort, creativity, and problem-solving process ‚Äî not just your final submission
    
- Developing the skill of **documenting your learning**, which is essential for any creative career or digital portfolio
    

A well-documented process can raise your overall grade, even if your final product isn‚Äôt perfect.

## üìù What Each Entry Should Include

Use the following template for every class post. You can copy it from the ‚ÄúMod 1 Daily Entry Template‚Äù or duplicate a previous post.

### **1. # Progress**

- Write in full sentences about what you did or learned today
    
- Describe the **tools and techniques** you used and **why** you used them
    
- Include screenshots or images of your work by typing
    
- Mention any design choices or revisions you made
    

### **2. # Questions**

- Ask **specific questions** about techniques, tools, or problems you encountered
    
- Example: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to make my text glow softly?‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúDoes this look good?‚Äù
    
- Tag **@David Jones** so I can reply directly to your post
    

### **3. # Learning**

- Reflect on what you learned today or what you improved on
    
- Add your **Learning Goal tags** (e.g., LG1, LG2) to connect your progress to course expectations
    

### **4. # File Upload**

- Always upload your most recent project file (e.g., `.PSD`, `.AI`, `.STL`, `.MP4`)
    
- Even if your project isn‚Äôt finished, upload your current version so your progress is saved and backed up
    

### **5. # Peer Feedback (TAG Format)**

- Include feedback you received from a peer in **TAG** format:
    
    - **Tell** something you liked about their work
        
    - **Ask** a thoughtful question about a tool, effect, or technique
        
    - **Give** one suggestion for improvement
        
- Include both the feedback you received and how you plan to use it to improve your work

## üìÖ How Feedback Works

Unless there are **extenuating circumstances**, I will check and leave feedback on your entries **every day**.

This means that:

- If you **miss an entry** and go back to add it later, I won‚Äôt automatically see it.
    
- If you **update or change** an older post after I‚Äôve already marked it, I also won‚Äôt be notified of that change.
    

If you make a change to an old entry or add something new after the expected time, please **tag me directly** in your post using **@David Jones** to let me know you‚Äôve made an update.  
This ensures I can go back and review the change or give feedback as needed.

## ‚úÖ Tips for Success

- Avoid one-sentence answers ‚Äî **explain your process and reasoning**
    
- Be honest about what went well and what didn‚Äôt. Mistakes are part of learning
    
- The more detail you include, the easier it is for me to understand your growth and give meaningful feedback
    
- Consistency is key: aim to complete an entry **after every class** while your progress is still fresh
    
- If you ever fall behind or update an older entry, **tag @David Jones** to ensure I see the change
