>[!warning]
>This task is **not optional**, it is a required part of the course. Take this reflection seriously and answer each question thoughtfully. Your responses will be **taken into consideration when determining your grade**, as they help demonstrate your understanding, effort, and engagement throughout the Mod. The more **honest and detailed** you are, the more valuable your reflection will be for both you and me.

## ⚠️ AI: Self-Reflection Expectations

The **self-reflection for this mod must be written by you**. This reflection is a critical part of the learning process and is meant to show **your own thinking** as you look back on how you used your time, the choices you made, the challenges you faced, and what you learned throughout the mod.

### AI Use in Reflections

AI use for this reflection is **very limited**. It may only be used for:

- Translation support (for example, helping translate your own writing into English)
    
- Clarifying vocabulary after you have written your response
    

AI **must not** be used to generate ideas, structure your reflection, or write sentences or paragraphs for you.

### Why This Matters

A self-reflection only has value if it is **authentic**. The purpose is for _you_ to think critically about:

- How effectively you used class time
    
- What skills and tools you actually developed
    
- What you would do differently in a future mod
    

If an AI writes this reflection for you, it completely defeats the purpose. I am no longer assessing your learning or your thinking, only your ability to submit something that looks complete.

Reflections that clearly rely on AI-generated writing may receive **reduced or no credit**, as they do not meet the intent of the task.

Take this seriously. Honest, imperfect reflections are far more valuable than polished writing that does not represent your own thinking.
