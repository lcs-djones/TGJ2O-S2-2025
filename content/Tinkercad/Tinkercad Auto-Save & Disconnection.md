# ⚠️ Tinkercad Auto-Save & Disconnection Warning

Tinkercad automatically saves your work — but **only while connected to the internet**.  
If you leave your project open for too long, the connection to Tinkercad’s servers can time out.

When this happens, you’ll see a **red “Disconnected”** message at the top right of the screen.  
This means your project is **no longer saving**.

---

> [!danger] 🚨 What This Means
> - Any changes made while **Disconnected** will **not save**.  
> - If you close or reload the page, it will **revert back to the last saved version**.  
> - You could lose **hours of work** — or even your entire design.

---

> [!tip] ✅ How to Prevent This
> - Always **close your Tinkercad tab** when you’re done working.  
> - Before closing, **check the top-right corner** for the red **“Disconnected”** text.  
>   - If it’s visible, **your file is not saving** properly.  
> - When in doubt, **refresh the page while connected** before continuing to work.  

---

> [!warning] 🛠 If You See “Disconnected”
> Follow these two steps **immediately** to protect your work:
> 
> 1. **Export your file** as an `.STL` (as you normally would).  
>    This gives you a backup of your current design.  
> 
> 2. **Select everything** in your project (⌘ + A), then **copy and paste it into a new Tinkercad document**.  
>    This creates a new version that will properly sync once reconnected.  

---

> [!danger] 🔴 Final Warning
> If you **don’t export or copy your design** while disconnected and then **reload the page**,  
> Tinkercad will **erase all unsaved changes**.  
> You could lose **hours of work** — or even the entire project.  
>
> **Always check for the “Disconnected” message before closing or reloading your page.**

---

> [!note] 💾 Why You Must Always Submit an STL File
> This is one of the main reasons why it’s expected that you **submit an exported `.STL` file in every Notion post**,  
> no matter what stage your project is in.  
> 
> Exporting regularly ensures that:
> - You always have a **current backup** of your work.  
> - I can see your progress, even if your online version disconnects.  
> - You’re protected against **connection issues or data loss**.
> 
> 💡 Think of exporting as hitting **“Save” for your 3D design.**
